# Updates

This directory is meant to store variuos in project updates related to the
progress of development for Phlint App. Note that it is not necessary to review
these documents for new contributors to Phlint App (although you can if you're
interested).

This directory is meant more to store documentation of various refactors and/or
large changes to the code base of Phlint App that needed something longer than a
few short messages via our Discord Channel.
